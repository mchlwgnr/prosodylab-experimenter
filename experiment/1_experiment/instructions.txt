
Welcome!

In this experiment, you are asked to participate in a series of scripted dialogues.

First you are asked to read the dialogue.
When you're ready to record, you can proceed by pressing any key. 
You will then hear the question that one person is askign, and your task is to respond. 

After the recording, you will be asked how natural the response sounded given the preceding story (some might be a bit odd!).

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
